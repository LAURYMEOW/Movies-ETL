# Movies-ETL

We have been asked create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropiate transformation, and loads the data into existing tables.
In the repository there are 4 python codes that perform different cleaning tasks of the provided data. In the ETL create_database, the connection is made with SQL through the Database Engine to be able to read and handle the data in a more comfortable way.
In the Resources folder evidence is presented that the data has been successfully loaded into PGAdmin. See the movies_query.png and ratings_query.png images.
